// TASK-2
// The project was prepared for the second task by adding the following libraries
// -sass
// -material-ui

// In this task our aim is to understand the component interaction with each other. So you are expected to do the followings before the lesson if possible
// 1-To poppulate the header component with basic sub components with styles. You can divide the header compnent into three part,
// In the left side, there should be a small logo placeholder, you can put react logo there. So we need to build a logo component first
// In the middle part of the header, there must be application name field. Make this as a component as well.
// In the right part, there must be a account avatar component and a ring-bell component for notifications. Again these should be components. Do not focus on functionality for now
// For footer, you can only put down, "all rights reserved" term at the middle.
// Make a "Layout" component as a parent for all of this components.
// There must be also a "Content" component as a child of "Layput" component as well
// Therefore we have a one parent component which is "Layout" under the App.tsx and under this "Layout" component, we have three child components.
// Place them to the page, so that "header" lies at the top, "footer" lies at the bottom and the "content" spans the all the rest area between header and footer.
// You can start to use Material Ui components in the application. I highly recommend you to get used to it. I am dropping the link:
// https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/
// You can go over the components and see what you can use from those components.
// You can try to put side menu to the left of the "content" component and place some list items like vendors, customers, products, settings and so on.
// If you get stuck any point, don't spend so much time, instead do another task. If you dont have time, we can do them together as long as we have time.
// Hopefully, We will maka an introduction to state concept as well
