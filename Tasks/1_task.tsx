// TASK-1
// 1-Look at the internet sources regarding the folder structure of a react application and apply one of them 
// (It can be changed wrt further needs. Do not worry about the availablity of different variations to much.)
// 2-Build your first page which is dashboard. Dashboard page should contain the following components.
//     Header
//     Footer
// 3-Do not worry about routing at the first place. We will handle this later.
// 4-Try to implement moduling structure for scss. For each component there will be a module.scss file like header.module.scss
// 5-Header component may include 
//     a logo (use react logo for now), 
//     user avatar at the right to react account page ( at the most right and clickable, use my photo in the public folder for now, i will provide more relevant assets later)
//     user name and a greeting message( this component should be left side of the user avatar  )
// 6-Our aim is for this task to generate basic and stateless function-based react components and placing them in a page commponent.
// 7-The second aim is to be able to style them using scss.
// 8-Do not worry top much about typescript for now, we will focus on it after basics.
// 9-Once you finish your work, you can version it as 1.1.0 and so on, just increment the second number for each new version.
// 10-You can use any material to understand the things, but once you understand it, try to code it yourself.
