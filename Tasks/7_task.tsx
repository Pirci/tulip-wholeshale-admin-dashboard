// TASK-7
// Following operations were performed to prepare the project for the task. Some issues also were resolved
// Json server pagination was implemented is products page
// Table page arrows was activated for json-server pagination
// Vendors and customers were put to json-server
// Modals of vendor and customer were prepared

// In this task, our first easy mission is to setup the react-icons library to our project and use the relevant icons in
// our left navbar. Here is the official website of the react-icons library https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/

// Our second mission is to make the vendors and customers pages as products page. We need there table, search and
// pagination mechanism and customer and vendor add form. Records should be fetched from json server similar to products
// page. The json.db was prepared for this. You can check it first.

// Our third mission is prepare our tables for the nested routes. In the next tasks, we will build nested pages for display
// and edit purpose of the records in the table. To to that, we first need to be able to select table row and you can
// convert the table to the following one. https://mui.com/material-ui/react-table/#sorting-amp-selecting. Please keep in
// mind that we will not use the checkbox, so do not add it to table. We just need to track the hover over of records and 
// also which record is selected. You need to use the useState mechanism for this. Once the record is selected, at the 
// bottom right of the table, two buttons should be enabled (normally it is disabled). These buttons are delete and edit.
// Also, you can move the search box to bottom right for more convenient visual view. Later on we will make this table-style
// to a seperate component.
