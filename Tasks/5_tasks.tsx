// TASK-5
// The project was prepared for the fifth task by adding json server for mocking the interaction with backend

// In this task we will continue to make some exercises related with state and props. We will focus on the real useCases
// Our first useState application will be the form state management. We will manage the state of the form fields. You can start with the
// products page. In products page, make a  form component that includes the following fields: productName, productCategory, date, color,
// price, amount, vendor, isStockAvailable, demandRating.
// Color selection should be a radio component, that you can select only one of the color among five alternatives (red, blue, yellow, pink, white)
// For this radio button, the selection should be kept as another useState variable.
// As for isAvailable toggle button, again the useState mechanism should be used.

// Our second task will be implementing a toast notification component using state mechanism. You can take advantage of toast notification
// of material ui library. Just put two types of notification. First toast notification is when the adding of a new product operation is 
// successful and the second one is when it is failed due to a reason. 

// Our third task should be designing an table component for products in hand. We will later put some filtering and sorting mechanism.
// But for now just put a dummy data that i provided to you in constants part. You can use material ui table component for this.

// For now, do not spend time on server interaction, we w≈üll do it together.
