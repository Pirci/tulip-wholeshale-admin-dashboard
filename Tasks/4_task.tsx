// TASK-3
// The project was prepared for the fourth task by adding react router

// In this task we will make some exercises on props and states.To do that lets make some real examples in our project.
// Your first objective is to put a conditional view to the Products page. There must be two buttons at the top of the Products Page and under that, there must 
// be content section. When you cliked the first button you need to see the list of products page. When you clicked the second button, a form should be open 
// which is the product enterance form. Buttons should keep the active state and its background color should be changed accordingly. Please try to use the state
// mechanism the we studied on Monday. You dont need to spend time to produce a real form or list of objects although it is nice that if you do. But definitely 
// concantrate on applying of state mechanism. Do not worry about it if you cant. We will go over it on Wednesday. We will also extensively use the state mechanism 
// in the form components. So, if you put some basic input components and style it, our work become easier. thank you
