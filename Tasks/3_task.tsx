// TASK-2
// The project was prepared for the third task by adding a new drawer

// In this task we will make some practices about what we learned so far. 
// I placed a new drawer(sidebar) to the conten component which is not fixed positioned. You can design this according to your purposes.
// Position: fixed one is already there, instead i want you to see the drawer which is restricted to content area part
// We will briefly go over it on the lesson. But before you manipuate it. Put new buttons, list elements and icons and change its design. 
// This is your first exercise. You can keep all the sidebar routing list items in an array of objects.
// Secondly, now we have content component with a sidebar element, but we need a page component beside the sidebar, so your second
// exercise is to make this. Make a new component with a name PagaContainer or something like this and style it like putting proper 
// margins and paddings in a responsive manner. 
// Thirdly, make this PageContainer component HOC (higher order component), so that you can put whatever inside bwtween its opening and 
// closings tags, and it immediately projects it to the DOM. Research this a litte bit. If you cannot do it, no worries, we will go over it.
// Forth task is to put some hovering functionalities and ::before, ::after pseudo elements to nested scss styles. You can apply these 
// to avatar action element in the header bar. When you hover over it, its bg can change slightly. Plus you can put an "active" class to
// Sidebar list elements. When a list item is clicked, the clicked one have a different bg color, so we can now where we are 
// from the sidebar as well. By these ones, i want you to see how we can manipulate pseudo classes and elements.
// In the next lesson, i will focus on useState hoook, you can read it a little bit. It is one of the core concepts of the react.
// We will focus on it a little bit more and see its pratical usages.
